# Python Arithmetic Guide: Order of Operations âœ¨

In Python (and mathematics in general), the **order of operations** determines how expressions are evaluated. Remember it with **PEMDAS**:

**ðŸ”¹ P â€“ Parentheses `()`**  
Operations inside parentheses are evaluated first.

**ðŸ”¹ E â€“ Exponents `**`**  
Handles powers and roots next.

**ðŸ”¹ M / D â€“ Multiplication `*` & Division `/`**  
Evaluated from **left to right**.

**ðŸ”¹ A / S â€“ Addition `+` & Subtraction `-`**  
Finally, addition and subtraction are evaluated from **left to right**.

> âœ… Following this order ensures your Python calculations are accurate and predictable.

**help() displays two things:**

the header of that function round(number, ndigits=None). In this case, this tells us that round() takes an argument we can describe as number. Additionally, we can optionally give a separate argument which could be described as ndigits.
