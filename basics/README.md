# Python Arithmetic Guide: Order of Operations âœ¨

In Python (and mathematics in general), the **order of operations** determines how expressions are evaluated. Remember it with **PEMDAS**:

**ðŸ”¹ P â€“ Parentheses `()`**  
Operations inside parentheses are evaluated first.

**ðŸ”¹ E â€“ Exponents `**`**  
Handles powers and roots next.

**ðŸ”¹ M / D â€“ Multiplication `*` & Division `/`**  
Evaluated from **left to right**.

**ðŸ”¹ A / S â€“ Addition `+` & Subtraction `-`**  
Finally, addition and subtraction are evaluated from **left to right**.

> âœ… Following this order ensures your Python calculations are accurate and predictable.

**help() displays two things:**

the header of that function round(number, ndigits=None). In this case, this tells us that round() takes an argument we can describe as number. Additionally, we can optionally give a separate argument which could be described as ndigits.

                  PYTHON DECORATORS - THEORY
===========================================================

ðŸ”¹ 1. Introduction
    - A decorator in Python is simply a function that takes another 
      function as input and extends or modifies its behavior.
    - It allows us to add extra features to existing code 
      without changing the original function.
    - Think of it as "wrapping" a function with additional logic.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Why Use Decorators?
    âœ… Code reusability (write once, use everywhere).
    âœ… Keep functions clean (no need to edit original code).
    âœ… Useful for logging, authentication, timing, caching, etc.
    âœ… Follows DRY principle (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself).

ðŸ”¹ 3. How Do They Work?
    - A decorator is a higher-order function.
    - It usually defines an inner function (called a wrapper).
    - The wrapper adds extra behavior before/after the target function.
    - Finally, the decorator returns this wrapper.

    Example (conceptually):
        @decorator_function
        def my_function():
            pass

    Equivalent to:
        my_function = decorator_function(my_function)

ðŸ”¹ 4. Steps of a Decorator
    1. Define a decorator function.
    2. Inside it, create a wrapper function.
    3. Add extra code before/after calling the original function.
    4. Return the wrapper function.
    5. Use '@decorator' above the target function.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Real-Life Analogy
    - Imagine you are drinking tea â˜•.
    - The tea (main function) is the same.
    - But you can add sugar, milk, or ginger (decorators).
    - The base tea does not change, but its behavior (taste) is enhanced.
